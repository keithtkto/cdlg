              My average work day varies quite a bit but usually entails recording music at some point in the day. If it’s a writing session, I try to prepare a rough song idea or two prior to the artist arriving at my studio. Editing is a big part of music production these days, so some of that usually happens at the onset. For large recording dates at other studios, such as for larger orchestral string dates, at least a few hours of prep work is needed before downbeat. In general, I have to tailor my working hours around a typical musician’s working hours, which means late starts (11 a.m. at the earliest) and late nights (midnight at the latest).  Luckily, I use my back house as a studio so the commute is pretty great.
